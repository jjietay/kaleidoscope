# Writing script.md

The narration sets the timing for everything. Each picture appears on a word of the
narration. Write the script first, then make the voice, then the pictures.

## Learning order

Use the parts that fit the topic, in this order. Each part is one or more scenes.

| Part | What it does | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| hook | One question the viewer wants answered | 1 scene, under 15 s. A real problem, not a slogan. |
| intuition | A picture of the idea before any symbol | Concrete first: a real example, real numbers. |
| mechanism `{core=yes}` | How it works, step by step | The main part. Slowest pace. One step per sentence. |
| formal `{core=yes}` | The formula or the precise rule | Map every symbol to something already on screen. |
| worked example `{core=yes}` | The rule with real numbers | Small numbers that the viewer can check in their head. |
| your case | The user's own example from this project | **Only when it is real.** Skip it otherwise. |
| pitfalls | One or two common mistakes | Good place for "your case" bugs. |
| recap | Three short points | Same words as the core scenes, so they connect. |

A concept the user has never used gets a longer intuition part and no "your case".

## How the voice reads (the user chose all of this by ear)

The voice is Chatterbox (`engine/tts`). It reads **a whole part in one go**: the words between
two `[pause]` marks or paragraph breaks. Inside a part the tone carries from sentence to
sentence, and each full stop gets 0.6 s of silence, so a fact has time to sink in.

What the user rejected, so never do it again:
- **A pause after every sentence.** It cut each sentence off on its own and made the voice
  sound the same all the time; with long gaps it spoke only half the video.
- **Short, choppy sentences** (6 words on average). They sound robotic.
- **A fast voice.** Chatterbox's normal pace (about 200 words a minute) was too fast; the
  skill slows it to about 160 with `engine/tts/slow-reference.wav`.
- **Stretched audio** to slow it down: it sounds muffled, "like a voice in another room".

## Pacing

- Slow comes from **fewer ideas a minute and the picture holding**, not from silence.
- `make voice` checks the rate: at most **145 words a minute in core scenes**, 170 elsewhere
  (pauses included). Fix a WARN by cutting words or adding a `[pause]` after a key point.
- `[pause 0.6]` to `[pause 1.6]` only where an idea ends or an animation needs time to play
  ("Apply M, and watch. [pause 1.6]"). An empty line between paragraphs gives 1 s.
- Give core scenes `{hold=2}` or more, so the last picture stays after the voice stops.
- **In core scenes, show at most one new thing every 2 s.**
- **Say each key definition twice**: once in the mechanism, once in the recap, with the same words.
- Read a formula term by term, and highlight each term on its word.
- Length: 2 to 4 minutes for one concept. If the topic needs more, make two videos.

## Writing rules

- **Write the way a good tutor talks: connected sentences in short paragraphs.** 10 to 20
  words a sentence, joined with "and", "so", "which" where the ideas connect. Two or three
  sentences a paragraph, one idea a paragraph.
- Every sentence adds a fact or a step. No filler ("Let's dive in", "It's important to note").
- "You", plain words, active voice.
- Introduce each term before you use it. Use the user's own words for things in their project.
- Do not use en or em dashes in narration: use a full stop or a comma.
- Spell symbols the way they are said: `{λ|lambda}`, `{Σ|sigma}`, `{I2C|I squared C}`,
  `{x_1|x one}`, `{RL|R L}`, `{SAM|Sam}`.

## Markup (explainroo format)

```markdown
# Title

> A line that starts with ">" is a note and is not spoken.

## scene-id {core=yes hold=2}
First sentence. [pause 0.8] The matrix [#stretch] stretches this arrow.
The stretch factor is {λ|lambda}.
```

| Markup | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `## id` | New scene. The id must match `scene('id', ...)` in scenes.js. Use letters, digits, `-`. |
| `{core=yes}` | A core scene: stricter pacing check. |
| `{hold=2}` | The picture stays 2 s after the voice ends. |
| `{min=6}` | The scene lasts at least 6 s (for a scene with little or no narration). |
| `[#name]` | A cue at this point in the speech. Use it in scenes.js as `s.p('#name')`. |
| `[pause 0.8]` | 0.8 s of silence. It also ends a part: the voice starts the next words fresh. |
| `{shown|spoken}` | Subtitles show the first part, the voice says the second. |
| empty line | A paragraph break: 1 s of silence, and a new part. |

Any spoken word is also a cue: `s.p('eigenvector')` is the first time the voice says it,
`s.at('eigenvector', 2)` the second. Use `[#name]` when the word is common or repeated.

## After `make voice`

`make voice` already does these by itself:
- puts a comma between a repeated short word ("one one" → "one, one"),
- stops with an ERROR when a negative number would be read "minus",
- compares Whisper's transcript of every part with its text and **retakes a part that says
  something else** with a new seed (up to 3 times), keeping the good seed for next time,
- sets every pause from the script's punctuation (full stop 0.6 s, comma at most 0.3 s)
  and WARNs when it cannot place one.

What is left for you:
- Each scene shows "% confirmed", from Whisper. **Read the transcript of any scene below
  100%** (`build/voice/<scene>.json`, "transcript"): Whisper writes numbers as digits, so
  "3, 3" for "three three" is fine, but a changed word is a bad take.
  Example: the voice said "one minus one" for "one one". Fix it by changing the spoken
  text (`{(1, 1)|one, one}`: repeated words trip it), or by giving that scene a new seed
  in `video.json`: `"_tts": {"seeds": {"recap": 8}}` for a whole scene, or `{"stay#5": 8}` for
  one part (parts are numbered in `build/_voice/tts-jobs.json`).
- **A repeated phrase that sounds mechanical** ("negative three, negative three" with the same
  melody twice): try another seed for that part first. The user chose a new take over
  changing the words.
- The table shows each scene's length. Write the storyboard with these lengths.

## Voice traps (Chatterbox)

- **Repeated short words** ("one one"): `make voice` adds the comma itself.
- **Symbols run fast.** The voice says short symbol words ("lambda v is v") much faster than
  normal words, and a symbol needs more time, not less. Give each new symbol its own short
  sentence and a `[pause]`: "On the right is lambda v. [pause 0.6] That is v, scaled by
  lambda." `make voice` measures every clause and WARNs "fast" when one is more than 1.3
  times the usual pace after 3 retakes.
- Numbers in brackets: `{(1, 0)|one zero}`. Decimals: `{0.5|zero point five}`.
- **A negative number is "negative", never "minus"** (the user asked): `{(1, -1)|one, negative one}`,
  `{-3|negative three}`. Say "minus" only for a subtraction: `{5 - 3|five minus three}`.
- Acronyms letter by letter: `{CNN|C N N}`, `{PCA|P C A}`, `{RGB|R G B}`.
- **It sometimes changes a small word** ("Pick" for "Take"). The transcript shows it.
- Technical words: listen to the first video with a new word, or check the transcript.
  It says "eigenvector" correctly (the old Kokoro voice did not).
